# Gingerbread Coaster Creator
This is a program that takes a CSV of track data from a roller coaster. (Possibly created with a program like No Limits 2) and creates paper templates to create molds for Twizzlers and cutouts for Graham Crackers from. Then you can construct your rollercoaster as a gingerbread coaster.

## Example

The rainbow colored supports are where Graham Crackers should go, and the red and blue smaller markers mark where individual Twizzlers should start and end.
